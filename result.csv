https://piazza.com/class/l7102doc7aa3ob/post/528,"smoothing the emissions matrix would sacrifice efficiency due to its size. edit to add further explanation: you only need to smooth the emission matrix for unseen words. this is because smoothing the entire emissions matrix will assign too much probability to unseen events. that is, smoothing will result in a words having probabilities for tags they were not associated with in the training. thus, sacrificing accuracy in addition to efficiency. smoothing is typically done to either the transition or the emissions matrix. transition is typically chosen because some probabilities need to be reserved as unseen. for example, what if a noun/verb pair were never seen in the training data? does that mean a noun/verb pair will never appear while testing? take the sentence 'dogs lick'. the model would not be able to assign a non-zero transition probability between dogs/noun -> lick/verb. therefore, the absence of smoothing would lead to the verb being mistagged, thus impacting accuracy.",0.5353132486343384

https://piazza.com/class/l7102doc7aa3ob/post/528,"can we not apply smoothing while decoding? as a part of the model, we just save the frequencies and calculate the smoothed frequencies while decoding. eg. emission : p(word|tag) = (c(word, tag) + 1)/ (c(tag) + #uniquetags) for transition: eg. p(tag|prev_tag) = (c(prev_tag, tag) + 1)/ (c(prev_tag) + #uniquetags) cannot we calculate this while looping over all possible tags for a word when we are decoding? i think i have understood this wrong, pls help!",0.48520326614379883
https://piazza.com/class/l7102doc7aa3ob/post/579,"laplace smoothing was covered in the first week of class @490, and again last week (lecture 13 on october 4). smoothing each row just means treating each outgoing transition separately. that is, we perform smoothing on all the transitions from noun; separately, we perform smoothing on all the transitions from verb; and so on. because each of these is a separate probability distribution.",0.4663769602775574
https://piazza.com/class/l7102doc7aa3ob/post/536,"sophisticated smoothing could lead to a small improvement, but if the accuracy you are getting is not in the general range of the baseline or reference, then you probably have a bug or error, and finding and fixing that would lead to more improvement than fiddling with the smoothing method",0.456152081489563
